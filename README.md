# MasmHighlighter
Masm Highlighter for Visual Studio 2015 from http://asmhighlighter.codeplex.com/

This is a copy of the repository from http://asmhighlighter.codeplex.com/. Since they are a few instructions missing I decided to host the 
sourcecode myself to expand it at my own needs.  Also updated to Visual Studio 2015 (at the moment of creation of this repository)

The build is tested and working on Visual Studio 2015.

If the new AsmHighlighter version doesn't highlight your asm code, you can try to remove the registry entry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0\FontAndColors\Cache
(this solution isn't my invention but from somewhere on the internet)
